  "description": "This project consists of two applications: SPA and API. Built on modern and promising technology. The client part is a bunch of Nuxt.js, Vuetify, and other modules ( seriously, there are a lot of them :3 ). The server part is a bunch of Nest.js + TypeORM ( MySQL ) + Swagger + Multer. The impetus for the creation of this project was the lack of our own website from our organization.",
